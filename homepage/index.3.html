  <h1>About Astoria</h1>
  <div class=boxed>
  <div class="a">
  <p1>Much like New York itself, Astoria is a small neighborhood that encapsulates the idea of diversity and change. There isn’t exactly a specific lingo, or a specific group of people pertaining to Astoria. People come and go all the time, leaving the neighborhood to diversify in culture as time goes by. It has stores of all kinds as well, ranging from small delis and kiosks sellings chips or food, to restaurants trying to bring about a certain culture. For such a small neighborhood, there are definitely tons of aspects that have yet to be unfolded. </p1>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
  <p2>Astoria as a whole is quite vast, with many characteristics that can’t be experienced all in one day. To be quite frank, after living here for roughly 16 years, I still don’t feel as if I’ve personally experienced the neighborhood to its true potential. A common perception from Astoria’s residents is that change is basically inevitable here. A rising store could potentially witness renovation or even the unfortunate circumstance that leads to replacement. Small stores nowadays must bring an enticing plate to the table or they can expect to be gone within a year. While depressing, change from a consumer perspective isn’t all that bad. More options suddenly arise in order to satisfy the diverse desires of the public. Not only is this applicable to restaurants and such, but to features open to the public as well. Outdated train stations; the rickety steps, the moldy walls along with the cramped pathways all provided a good enough reason to resent using trains. This persisted until the train stations took the public’s opinions, like many restaurants, to redesign the interior, either for convenience or to rival the rapidly growing neighborhoods. The changes within Astoria are occasionally very small as well. Schools have taken the initiative to start planting trees and different types of plants in order to help bring change to the deteriorating environment we so call home. The community here is quick to realize whether change is necessary or not in order to benefit Astoria as a whole.</p2>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
  <p3>The senses Astoria provides can’t really be explained without visiting, or at least for my general area. One second, you’re breathing in the fresh smell of steaming burgers coming from the vast array of burger joints and then the smell of trash the next. You might be all alone on one block, seeing nothing but leaves scattering the ground, or cars driving by in a hurry to find a parking spot, but the instant you turn a corner, you might see tons of cars racing to make the light, while large crowds pass by either to make the trains, catch up to their friends, or carrying home their groceries. With how diverse the neighborhood is, it comes as no surprise that you see a range of people everywhere you go. From hobos that roam the streets, to nicely dressed people that are getting off the train. With people of all races, you experience different cultures that reside in such a small neighborhood. Besides the people, there are a range of stores as well. On one block, restaurants and little bodegas line up, while the next contains a playground, filled with the laughter of kids and the conversing parents. No one is arguing or even fighting over a certain topic. Either you’re calmly talking to someone or you just mind your own business.</p3>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
  <p4>If you were to look for a place to relax or settle down peacefully, I would tell you to look no further then Astoria. For such a small neighborhood, it contains a park that is, while not very known outside of Astoria, peaceful and big enough for anyone to go relax with their friends. Sure you can go to Central Park but can you truly relax there without hearing some sort of external disturbance. With how rapidly expanding/ growing Manhattan is, Central park tends to become a little noisy. Which is where Astoria Park comes in. I’ve been there countless times and it can truly confirm for itself that it is much more peaceful in comparison to Central Park. While not as  extensive, since many people don’t come on a daily basis, there aren’t large enough crowds capable of bringing discomfort to the mind. Some people go to lay down or exercise, either by themselves or with friends. Some people even walk along the shore to get their sunset photos or to just simply lay their eyes on the east river. While not as bustling as neighborhoods like Flushing or Forest Hills, it offers the same, if not more, opportunities to anyone who wishes for a more tranquil experience. As underrated as it is, Astoria is definitely a place that has its perks while exceeding many of its expectations.</p4>

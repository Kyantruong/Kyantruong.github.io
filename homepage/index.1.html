    <h1>Astoria Park</h1>
    <p1>   Astoria Park is a one of a kind. While it may not be as grand as parks such as Central Park or Prospect Park, it still has its own little spark. For both aforementioned parks, they are heavily populated meaning they atract tons of visitor everyday. 
    This aspect is much different from Astoria Park's environment. Its small community leaves only a few people walking the windy paths it has. If you're looking for a peaceful, yet large, park, then Astoria Park is just for you. It even contains a path along the East River, leaving tons of room for beautiful sunset pictures with the bridge.</p1>
